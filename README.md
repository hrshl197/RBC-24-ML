Problem Statement:
There are five silos in the environment and two agents. One agent has blue ball and another agent has red ball. Each agent has to put ball in silo in random turns. One Silo can hold 3 balls.
To win the game an agent has to win atleast three silo. If no agent is able to win atleast three silo then agent which has maximum number of ball present in all the silo wins the game.
To win a silo there should be atleast two ball of one agent in a solo and one of the ball should be present at top most position.
